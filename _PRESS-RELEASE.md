  Society is a fun multiplayer experience for all ages that brings the childhood concept of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" to a whole new level.
  Built upon the iteration of the original RPS game by software development leader, Sam Kass, Society adds a satirical theme with new elements: “Rich”, “Bum”, “Cop”, “Tax”, “Jail”.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  The game is visually asthetic, more interactive, more strategic iteration upon Rock Paper Scissors.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  Players must predict their opponent’s choices based on a Health-Point system attached to each option.
  The "health points" of each option decline once that option is overcome by a “superior” one.
  As these points reach zero, that option will be rendered unavailable, and the player must choose the next option with much more care than before.
  Society allows its players to invite friends into private rooms; or they may choose to join a Queue, which matches each player according to their skill level (MatchMaking Rating).
  When a player enters this overall Queue, they must battle opponents and climb to the top of the leaderboard.
